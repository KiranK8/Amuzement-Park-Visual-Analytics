The crowd that gathered at DinoFun World this weekend to honor local star and international soccer celebrity Scott Jones were ready to hand out more than a red card to the individuals who vandalized a pavilion exhibiting Jones’s memorabilia and made off with an Olympic medal and possibly other irreplaceable items. 

“How could they do this to him?” sobbed one distraught fan, shortly after learning about the incident. “He means so much to all of us and our town!”  

The crime forced partial closure of DinoFun World and local police were on the scene shortly after the vandalism was discovered by park visitors.  

Security guards are being questioned to eliminate the possibility of an inside job. “Creighton Pavilion was closed and locked up tight before each show,” stated Park Chief of Security Barney Wojciehowicz. “We needed the extra security at the Stage area to ensure visitor safety since the crowds were so large there. We’ve just never had any problems at the Pavilion prior to this.”

Scott Jones’s representatives were not available for comment.
