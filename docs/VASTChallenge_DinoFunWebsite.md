Born to Sydney Albright Jones, high school chemistry teacher, and Karl Jones, a professional photographer, Scott was involved with soccer at a very young age.  Beginning when he was 4 years old Scott accompanied his Uncle Matt, a coach for the Markston Regional Clubs League, to all the games, practices and championships.

“It was fun,” Scott told News Team 6 reporter Mako Harrison during a recent interview.  “Uncle Matt let me help during practice.  I’d kick the ball to the other kids so they could practice blocking and stealing.”  He laughs.  “But I was half the height of most of them.  Just this little kid wanting to be a part of the team.”

It didn’t take long, however until Scott was part of a team.  He excelled in the Youth Soccer League, and when in high school, led his regional club to the national championship.

“It started out just some friends and me kicking the ball around, having fun in the Leagues,” Scott told local News Team 6 reporter Mako Harrison during a recent interview.  “We – Lonzo, Eddie, Marcus and I – played football, er, soccer after school, weekends, every minute we could.  We were always together.  Right after homework was done we’d be out in the street, kicking the ball.”

Scott and two of his friends received college scholarships to play soccer at the State University.  They’d just led their team to the National Championships for the second year in a row when Scott had an opportunity to play on the US Men’s Soccer team.

“It was such an honor, but it was a hard decision, too.  I had no time for my family or friends.  Everything I did was directed to just one goal.”

After the team won the Summer Olympics, Scott was offered a multi-year contract with an international team for an unheard of salary.

“At first I told them ‘no’,” Scott tells us.  “I was determined to finish college, but they kept sweetening the deal. Eventually I decided it was an opportunity for me to learn more about the world.”

Since Scott’s retirement from professional soccer he has been coaching youth around the world in Beach Soccer, and plans to be a guest coach with the girl's soccer team at Rosepark School next fall.
