## Visual Analytics Assignments

This repository contains the templates for the assignments of lecture Visual Analytics.


### Application scenario

In most of the assignments we will work on the VAST Challenge 2015.

> The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is an annual 
contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics through competition. 
The VAST Challenge is designed to help researchers understand how their software 
would be used in a novel analytic task and determine if their data transformations, 
visualizations, and interactions would be beneficial for particular analytic tasks. 
VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets 
for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field 
by solving more complex problems.

More information concerning the 2015 challenge can be found in the [challenge description](docs/VastChallenge2015.md) which is a local reader friendly copy of the official documents.


### Assignments

The Project is grouped into four assignments. 

1. [Working with databases and Bokeh](A1_queryVis/assignment1.md)
