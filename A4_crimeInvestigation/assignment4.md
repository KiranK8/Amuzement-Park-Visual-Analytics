# Assignment 4: Analyzing Unusual Activities

In this assignment you will inspect unusual activities in the park including the
crime that happened. This assignment is an open data analysis and you are
allowed to choose from the following tasks.

Total points in this assignment: 32P (more than 100% is possible)

Notice that, regarding the multiple choice questions below, ticks can be made with an "x" in the brackets in the Markdown code.


## Exercise 1: Visitors with unusual activities (4 x 4P)

Explore the unusual behavior of the people listed below, fulfilling the following tasks.

1. Select the valid/likely statements about them by checking the respective items.
2. Describe the unusual pattern in their activities (around 50 words and at least one image per bullet point).

- Visitor 1187304
    * [ ] visits the park on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
    * [ ] loves Kiddie rides
    * [x] is a marathon roller coaster rider
  

Visitor 1187304's pattern on Saturday clearly showcases a dedication to thrill rides, particularly the Long Coaster. Out of the total 90 minutes spent in the park, 73 were on the Long Coaster alone, accounting for over 80% of their total park time. This intense focus on one thrilling ride, rather than exploring varied attractions, marks them as a "marathon roller coaster rider." Such behavior is atypical as most visitors tend to explore multiple attractions, confirming their specific interest in marathon roller coaster experiences. This visitor didnot visit the park on Friday and Sunday. During his jounrney in the park he didnt visit Kiddie rides even once.

- Visitors 258464 and 74766
    * [ ] are real Scott Jones fans and watch all his shows
    * [x] take a couple of attempts to finally dare to go on the SkyDiver
    * [ ] get a tattoo
    
The behavioral patterns of visitors 258464 and 74766 at the SkyDiver attraction demonstrate a hesitancy typical of those building up courage for a thrilling experience. Data indicates that both visitors visited the SkyDiver multiple times (3 times) throughout the day but didnot check-in, before finally checking in at 11:34. Their frequent visits suggest preparation or hesitation. Figures also show that that they didnot get a tattoo and didnt watch all Scott Jones shows.

- Visitors 657863, 1412235, 103006, 1937834, and 313073
    * [ ] are a family that spends the weekend in the park
    * [ ] spend more than 4 hours at the Ice Cream shop
    * [x] loose a friend on the train ride
  
The timeline visualizations highlight an unusual pattern concerning visitors 657863, 1412235, 103006, 1937834, and 313073 during their train ride on the Train (Red). While all these visitors boarded the train together at 09:53, they were expected to disembark together at 10:21. However, only visitors 1412235, 103006, 1937834, and 313073 checked out of the train and left the park shortly after at 10:29. In contrast, visitor 657863 did not disembark with the others and remained on the train overnight, finally exiting the park the next morning at 08:10 AM. This distinct discrepancy in 657863's timeline suggests that he/she was inadvertently left behind or "lost" during the train ride, separating himself/herself from their group. Also from the graph it is evident that they didnot spend time on weekend as they visited the park only on Friday. and none of then visited Ice Cream Shop during their whole period.

- Visitors 1080969, 1600469, 1629516, 1781070, 1935406, 521750, and 644885
  * [ ] take more than 20 thrill rides per day
  * [ ] are security that accompany Scott Jones to his shows
  * [x] stay at the stage during the daily shows

The behavior of visitors 1080969, 1600469, 1629516, 1781070, 1935406, 521750, and 644885 at the park reveals a distinct pattern: they consistently spent extensive periods at the stage during daily shows. On both Friday and Saturday, they were present at the stage from 09:29 AM to 11:24 AM, and again from 02:29 PM to 04:34 PM, indicating they stayed to watch the performances in their entirety. This prolonged engagement at the stage, across multiple days, aligns with their interest in the shows rather than thrill rides, as there is no evidence of them partaking in more than 20 thrill rides per day. This focused attendance at the stage supports the observation that they were there specifically for the shows, likely as dedicated fans or possibly in an official capacity, or security that accompany Scott Jones to his shows rather than casual amusement park visitors.

## Exercise 2: Anomalies at attractions (4 x 4P)

Explore the unusual visitor patterns of the attractions listed below, fulfilling the following tasks.

1. Select the valid/likely statements about them by checking the respective items.
2. Describe the unusual pattern (around 50 words and at least one image per bullet point).

- Red Train "Scholtz Express" (ride 20): extraordinary closing?
    * [ ] gets closed on Friday
    * [x] gets closed on Saturday
    * [ ] gets closed on Sunday
  
From the analysis of the scatter plot data concerning the Red Train "Scholtz Express" (ride 20), it is observed that on Saturday, there is an unusual pattern of no check-ins recorded around 13:22 to 13:50. This gap in activity suggests that the attraction was unexpectedly closed during this period, which is not typical for such a popular ride. The abrupt absence of check-ins during these prime hours could indicate operational interruptions, possibly for maintenance or other unforeseen issues. 

Visual Evidence:
The scatter plot distinctly shows a lack of red points (check-ins) during the specified timeframe on Saturday, supporting the conclusion of an extraordinary closure. This visual gap contrasts with the consistent check-ins visible at other times, highlighting the anomaly. Where as from the below graphs, there were no such closing period on Friday and Sunday

- Galactosaurus Rage (ride 2): problems with operation?
    * [ ] has no unusual patterns
    * [ ] the ride is stuck on Friday (people cannot get off for some time)
    * [x] the ride is closed for roughly one hour on Friday
  
For the "Galactosaurus Rage" ride (ride 2), the observed data clearly indicates an operational disruption on Friday. The pattern displayed shows an absence of check-ins around 19:03 to 20:02, suggesting the ride was closed during this hour. This unusual gap, particularly during an evening period typically characterized by high visitor activity, supports the conclusion that the ride experienced a significant operational issue, possibly for maintenance or due to a malfunction.

Visual Evidence:
The scatter plot distinctly lacks points in the 19:03 to 20:02 period on Friday, confirming the closure. This lack of activity is atypical for such a popular attraction during peak hours and indicates a noteworthy interruption in its operation, highlighting the anomaly. Where as from the below graphs, there were no such closing period on Saturday and Sunday.

- Scott Jones show occurs at the Grinosaurus Stage (attraction 63): opening hours?
    * [ ] The stage is open: every day 8:00 - 11:00
    * [ ] The stage is open: every day 13:00 - 16:00
    * [x] Many people are not aware of the closing after the vandalism and try to go to the show on Sunday afternoon
  
At the Grinosaurus Stage (attraction 63), there's a notable pattern of visitor behavior that suggests a lack of awareness about operational changes following an incident of vandalism. The data from the scatter plots distinctly shows regular check-ins (marked in red) occurring primarily between 14:30 and 15:15 on Friday and Saturday, aligning with the expected show times. However, despite the stage's closure on Sunday afternoon, a significant number of movements (marked in blue) around the same time interval indicate that numerous visitors were still attempting to attend the show, unaware of the disruption in the schedule.

Visual Evidence:
The images from Sunday illustrate a clear influx of visitor movements around the usual show times without corresponding check-ins, emphasizing the confusion or lack of communication regarding the temporary closure. Images also show everyday Visitors Check-in around 9:30 to 10:15 in the morning and 14:30 to 15:15 in the afternoon. Hence the stage opening hour is not 8:00 in the morning and 13:00 in the afternoon.

- Creighton Pavilion (attraction 32): opening hours?
    * [ ] is open all day
    * [ ] closes on Sunday at 11:00am
    * [x] hosts the exhibition of Scott Jones' memorabilia
    
The Creighton Pavilion's check-in patterns reveal that it doesn't operate continuously, particularly evidenced by a notable absence of check-ins during certain period of time everyday. It is not true that the attraction closing at 11:00 AM on Sundays,as from images,it shows activity extending beyond this time, with check-ins from 11:30 to 12:00 on Sunday. This supports the 3rd option i,e venue's use for special events, such as Scott Jones' memorabilia exhibition, indicated by consistent, scheduled visitor activities during specific hours.

Visual Evidence:
The provided images underscore these findings, displaying clustered check-ins during expected exhibition hours and clear inactivity periods that align with operational breaks or preparation periods for the next event.

Participation and Timeframe for Vandalism
Based on Eddie's frequent and significant time spent at the Pavilion, it is likely that he played a key role in the vandalism and theft. 

Here’s a plausible timeframe for the crime:

Friday:
Eddie's visit from 13:39 PM to 14:05 PM could have involved planning or initial acts of vandalism.

Saturday:
Eddie's visits, particularly from 08:57 AM to 09:28 AM and 12:04 PM to 12:32 PM, indicate substantial time spent, possibly coordinating with others or conducting acts of vandalism.

Sunday:
The visit from 08:32 AM to 09:13 AM could be the final act, involving the theft of the Olympic gold medal.
Alice and Bob's lack of presence at the Pavilion suggests they did not directly participate in the vandalism at this location. However, their interactions with Eddie, especially on other rides and locations, might indicate they were involved in planning or supporting roles.

Conclusion
Eddie was present at the Creighton Pavilion during critical times on all three days, making him the most likely primary participant in the vandalism and theft. Alice and Bob, while not present at the Pavilion, interacted with Eddie at various points, suggesting they could have been involved in planning or aiding the crime indirectly.
